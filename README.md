# Largest of 3 

Write a function to find the largest of 3 numbers.

## Problem Description
The function `largest_num(x, y, z)` is defined with 3 parameters. Those represent the 3 numbers that the function
 will accept and compare.   


## Example 1
```
x = 6
y = 12
z = 2

>>> 12
```

## Example 2
```
x = 5
y = 2
z = 5

>>> 5
```

## Suggested Approach
* Complete the function so it compares x, y and z to find the largest one.
    * The function should return the largest number 
* Test your function with the print statement in `main`. Feel free to use multiple prnt statements to check different
 scenarios at the same time.
 * ((Optional) When you know your function works, feel free to add `input` statements in `main` so you can choose the
  numbers while the program is running.
  * Be sure to run `pytest` to be sure everything works as expected.
  * Commit & push to GitHub - and then check GitHub to verify your work is there!
  
## Hints
* Related conditional statements should use `if`, `elif` and `else`. Avoid a series of `if` statements.
* Functions can have multiple `return` statements, as long as they are all at an end of the function. (There can be
 multiple endings!)
 * Be sure to address the case where numbers are equal!
